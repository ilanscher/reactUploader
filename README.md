Hello,

THis aplication works with a connection of Node.js and React.

Upload any image (or file) and you will see it was uploaded and stored in to your "public" folder of this App. You can change the "Post" now to ant other location you want for your App.
Good Luck!

Getting Started with Uploader App:

install this:
"npm i express multer cors react-toastify styled-components axios reactstrap"

Next run: `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
